For this extra credit, my approach was to basically output the same html file everytime, except it will change the amount of websites/csv files in the drop-down boxes based on how many were used in site-tester. So the user can choose a website to inspect and a batch and they will see the count of all the terms given to site-tester on that site for that batch. I chose not to try to display all the sites at once as I am new to d3 and could not seem to get it to work. I used mostly firefox and chrome for testing this, but it does seem to run on microsoft edge as well.
