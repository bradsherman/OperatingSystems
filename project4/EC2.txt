For this extra credit I chose to write a separate function that searches for 
"<body". If it finds it, it will return the string from that position until the 
postion where it finds "</body". I left the ">" off the end because if the body 
tag has attributes then this function would skip over it. If this function does 
not find the opening body tag, it will just return the original string. Then, I 
have another function that just counts the number of occurences of a term in a 
string.
